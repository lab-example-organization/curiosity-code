screwedUp: TRUE # understand, 'screwed up' specifically means you're running non-sequential runs that COULD have different params in both CURSTART and CURINH(distribution)- if enabled, this param brings about the need for bracketed vectors on each of these could-be-variable params s.t. indices of the params' vectors will be matched up by the parallelizing script. CurinhDistribution only needs a character vector when curinh_pattern = 5.
